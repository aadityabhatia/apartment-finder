# Blaze Apartment Finder

A geek starts looking for an apartment. Craigslist has some good listings, but is hard to navigate and keep track of. Geek invents a tool to simplify the process by displaying only the relevant bits. Meet [Blaze Apartment Finder](http://apt.dragonsblaze.com/).

## Features

 * Find places by distance and travel time
 * Sort by distance or rent (and by travel time, soon)
 * View full description with a high-res map, all in one window

## ToDo

 * tie location to search - currently hardcoded to Mountain View, CA
 * support search by cities, neighborhoods
 * compute travel time as soon as results appear, instead of waiting for user action
